# Textchan
Textchan is a lightweight textboard written in NodeJS (I know, eww, but I don't like PHP)

## Setup
To run Textchan, make sure you have NodeJS and MongoDB installed, then go into the root directory
of the Textchan instance, run `npm install`, then run `node textchan.js`.

You also may change `config.json` to how you wish
